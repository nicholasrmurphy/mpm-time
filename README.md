# mpm-time
This project was started with the intent of digitizing a contractors process of collecting timesheets. 
The information from these forms was then used for payroll and client billing by hour. 
This software allows users to create an account and begin recording work entries to the database.  
These entries can then be viewed and organized with the help of the application.  

The URL where this project is currently running is https://mpm-timesheet.azurewebsites.net

The software requires a registration code to begin using it, so outside use is prohibited. 
If a demonstration is requested I encourage reaching out to arrange one.
